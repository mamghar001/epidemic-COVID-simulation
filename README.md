Basic epidemic simulation application (Covid 19)
================================

How To Use graphe_circulaire_et_personnalise (done by me) :
---------------
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

- Modify constants such as `PROBA_DEATH`, `CONTAGION_RATE` and `VACCINATION_RATE`... (All variables are on the first part of code and could be played with)

- Run the simulation through:
`python graphe_circulaire_et_personnalise.py` for circular and personalised graph 

- The game will show up

- Press the Space bar to run the simulation

- Repress the Space bar to show statistics of the simulation

- Enjoy

- Exit the Program
